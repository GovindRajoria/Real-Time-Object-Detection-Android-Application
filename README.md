# Real-Time Object Detection Android Application

## Overview

This Android application leverages **TensorFlow Lite** and the **Camera2 API** to perform real-time object detection. Built using **Kotlin**, the app detects and classifies objects from a live camera feed. It supports detection of 90 object classes, using the **SSD MobileNet** pre-trained deep learning model. The detected objects are visualized by drawing bounding boxes and displaying labels on the camera frames.

## Features

- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Detects and classifies objects in real-time using a mobile camera.
- **TensorFlow Lite Integration**: Optimized pre-trained **SSD MobileNet** model for efficient inference on mobile devices.
- **Supports 90 Object Classes**: Detects a wide variety of objects, from everyday items to complex scenes.
- **Low Latency**: Real-time frame processing with minimal delays.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Optimized for low CPU and memory usage, suitable for mobile environments.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and responsive UI to display the results with bounding boxes and labels.

- Android Studio 4.x or higher.
- A physical Android device with Camera2 API support.

### Steps to Run the Application

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-object-detection.git
   ```

2. **Open the project in Android Studio**:
   - Launch Android Studio and open the cloned project.

3. **Sync the Gradle Files**:
   - Sync the project with Gradle to install all necessary dependencies.

4. **Build and Run**:
   - Connect a physical Android device (or use an emulator with Camera2 API support).
   - Build and run the app on the device.

## How It Works

1. **Capture Frames**: The app uses the Camera2 API to capture frames from the device's camera in real-time.
2. **Object Detection**: These frames are passed to the **SSD MobileNet** model, which detects and classifies objects in the image.
3. **Display Results**: Detected objects are visualized by drawing bounding boxes around them and displaying the corresponding labels on the screen.
4. **Real-Time Processing**: The app provides immediate feedback, updating the detection results for each frame processed.

## Model and Dataset

The application uses the **SSD MobileNet** model, a fast and efficient deep learning model trained for object detection. The model is pre-trained to detect 90 different object classes, using the **COCO (Common Objects in Context)** dataset.

For a complete list of detected object classes, please refer to the `labels.txt` file included in the model metadata.
